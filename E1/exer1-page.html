    <p>
      Nothing is the lack or absence of anything (including empty space).
      "Nothing" and "zero" are closely related but not identical concepts. The
      term "nothing" is rarely used mathematically, though it could be said that
      a set contains nothing iff (if and only if) it is the empty set, in which
      case its cardinality (or size) is zero. Nothing differs from zero in the
      way that zero is something, a finite amount which is defined. While
      nothing overlaps the quantity zero, in the way that it also is, when
      finitely defined, zero, it differs in the way that it has no specific
      basis like zero does in numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a philosophical point of view, the concept of "nothing" can have many
      interpretations. In fact, people can even state that nothing does not
      exist. One cannot sense, see, feel, or think nothing. There is no contact
      with nothing. Nothing is where everything isn't. Visualizing "nothing"
      would make "something". It could be seen as a physical void or as just a
      word which only has meaning when used to describe a relationship between
      different "somethings". A single "correct" definition of nothing could be
      considered impossible, since "right" and "wrong" do not fit within the
      confines of nothing.
